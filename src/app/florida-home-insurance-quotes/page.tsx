  {
    question: 'What information do I need to get a Florida home insurance quote?',
    answer: 'To get an accurate quote you\'ll need: your home\'s address and year built, square footage and construction type (frame, masonry, or mixed), roof age and material, your current coverage amounts and deductibles, any recent claims in the past 5 years, and your wind mitigation inspection report if you have one. Having your wind mitigation report ready before you shop can significantly reduce your quoted premium.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many quotes should I get for Florida home insurance?',
    answer: 'Get at least 3 quotes, and ideally 5 or more. In Florida, premium differences between carriers for the same property can be $2,000–$4,000 per year. The first quote you receive is rarely the best. An independent insurance agent can pull multiple quotes simultaneously, which is the most efficient way to compare.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to get a Florida home insurance quote?',
    answer: 'Online quotes from carriers like Kin or Lemonade can be generated in 5–10 minutes. Quotes from independent agents typically take 24–48 hours as they shop multiple carriers. For complex properties — older homes, coastal locations, prior claims — the quoting process may take longer as carriers may require inspections before binding coverage.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are Florida home insurance quotes so much higher than other states?',
    answer: 'Florida\'s premiums are driven by four factors: (1) Hurricane exposure — approximately 77% of Floridians live in hurricane-vulnerable areas; (2) Historical litigation abuse — Florida accounted for 79% of all U.S. homeowners insurance lawsuits despite 9% of claims, though 2022–2023 reforms have begun to address this; (3) Reinsurance costs — insurers must buy their own insurance, and Florida\'s risk makes that expensive; (4) Roof replacement costs — Florida\'s heat, humidity, and storm exposure accelerate roof deterioration.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the best way to lower my Florida home insurance quote?',
    answer: 'The single most impactful action is getting a wind mitigation inspection before you shop. A certified inspector documents your roof\'s storm resistance features, and this report can reduce your wind premium by 15–45%. Other effective strategies: install hurricane shutters or impact windows, raise your deductible, bundle with auto insurance, and work with an independent agent who can access multiple carriers.',

      <p>Florida home insurance quotes can vary by $2,000–$4,000 per year for the exact same property. That's not a typo. Florida's fragmented insurance market means that two carriers looking at the same home can arrive at dramatically different premiums based on their underwriting models, reinsurance costs, and appetite for Florida risk.</p>

      <p>Getting the best quote isn't about finding the right website — it's about understanding what drives your premium and presenting your property in the most favorable light to carriers. This guide walks you through the process.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Before You Get a Quote: The Wind Mitigation Inspection</h2>
      <p>If you do one thing before shopping for Florida home insurance, get a wind mitigation inspection. This is a $75–$150 inspection by a certified inspector who documents your home's storm-resistance features — roof shape, roof covering, roof deck attachment, roof-to-wall connections, and opening protection (shutters or impact windows).</p>
      <p>The resulting report is submitted to your insurance carrier and can reduce your wind premium by 15–45%. On a $5,000 annual premium, that's $750–$2,250 in annual savings. The inspection pays for itself in the first month.</p>
      <p><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> Any Florida homeowner can get a wind mitigation inspection. Homes built after 2002 generally qualify for the largest discounts because they were built to Florida's post-Hurricane Andrew building code. Older homes can still qualify for partial credits.</p>

      <h2>What Information You Need for an Accurate Quote</h2>
      <p>Florida insurers quote based on specific property data. Having this information ready before you start will save time and ensure you're comparing apples to apples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Property address and year built</strong> — Florida's building codes changed significantly after Hurricane Andrew (1992) and again after the 2004–2005 hurricane seasons. Year built is a major rating factor.</li>
        <li><strong>Square footage and construction type</strong> — Frame construction costs more to insure than masonry (concrete block) construction in Florida.</li>
        <li><strong>Roof age, material, and shape</strong> — Roof age is one of the most important rating factors. Many carriers won't write policies on roofs over 15–20 years old. Hip roofs (sloped on all four sides) cost less to insure than gable roofs.</li>
        <li><strong>Current coverage amounts</strong> — Know your dwelling coverage (the cost to rebuild, not the market value), personal property coverage, and liability limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Claims history</strong> — Carriers will pull your CLUE report (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) which shows claims for the past 7 years. Know what's on it before you shop.</li>
        <li><strong>Wind mitigation report</strong> — If you have one, bring it. It can dramatically change your quoted premium.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where to Get Florida Home Insurance Quotes</h2>
      <p>There are three main ways to get Florida home insurance quotes, each with different tradeoffs:</p>

      <h3>Independent Insurance Agents</h3>
      <p>An independent agent represents multiple carriers and can shop your policy across several companies simultaneously. This is the most efficient approach for most Florida homeowners, especially those with complex properties or prior claims. Independent agents also understand which carriers are currently competitive for specific property types and locations — knowledge that online quote tools don't have.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Most Florida homeowners, especially those with older homes, coastal properties, prior claims, or complex coverage needs.</p>

      <h3>Direct Carrier Quotes</h3>
      <p>Carriers like Kin Insurance, Lemonade, and some others offer direct online quoting. These tools are fast and convenient but only show you one carrier's rate. You'll need to visit multiple carrier websites to compare, and not all Florida carriers offer direct online quoting.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Newer homes with straightforward risk profiles looking for a quick baseline quote.</p>

      <h3>Comparison Websites</h3>
      <p>Online comparison tools can generate multiple quotes from one form submission. The tradeoff is that not all Florida carriers participate in these platforms, and the quotes may not reflect all available discounts (including wind mitigation credits).</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Getting a quick sense of the market before diving deeper with an independent agent.</p>

      <h2>How to Compare Florida Home Insurance Quotes Fairly</h2>
      <p>Comparing quotes requires more than looking at the annual premium. Make sure you're comparing equivalent coverage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dwelling coverage amount</strong> — Make sure all quotes use the same dwelling coverage limit. A quote for $250,000 in dwelling coverage will always be cheaper than one for $350,000.</li>
        <li><strong>Deductibles</strong> — Florida policies have two deductibles: a standard deductible (typically $500–$2,500) and a separate hurricane deductible (typically 2–5% of dwelling coverage). Compare both.</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage exclusions</strong> — Some cheaper policies exclude certain types of water damage, mold, or have limited coverage for personal property. Read the coverage summary carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier financial strength</strong> — Check AM Best ratings. A lower premium from a financially weak carrier is a false economy in Florida's storm-prone environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Replacement cost vs. actual cash value</strong> — Replacement cost coverage pays to rebuild or replace at current prices. Actual cash value coverage deducts depreciation. Always choose replacement cost if available.</li>
      </ul>

        <div className="number">3–5</div>
        <p className="mt-1 text-teal-100 text-sm">Number of quotes Florida homeowners should get before choosing a carrier. The difference between the first and best quote is often $1,500–$3,000 per year.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Red Flags in Florida Home Insurance Quotes</h2>
      <p>Not all low quotes are good deals. Watch for these warning signs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Carriers with AM Best ratings below A-</strong> — Financial weakness is a serious risk in Florida's storm environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Unusually low dwelling coverage</strong> — Some quotes look cheap because they're underinsuring your home. Make sure the dwelling coverage is enough to actually rebuild.</li>
        <li><strong>Surplus lines carriers</strong> — Surplus lines insurers are not covered by Florida's insurance guaranty fund if they become insolvent. They can be legitimate options, but understand the additional risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Carriers that recently entered Florida</strong> — New entrants haven't been tested by a major hurricane. Check their reinsurance arrangements and financial backing before committing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>Getting the best Florida home insurance quote is a process, not a transaction. Get a wind mitigation inspection, gather your property information, work with an independent agent, and compare at least 3–5 quotes on equivalent coverage terms. The time investment is typically 2–4 hours and the savings can be $1,500–$3,000 per year.</p>
