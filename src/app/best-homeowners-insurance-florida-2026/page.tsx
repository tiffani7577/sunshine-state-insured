    question: 'What is the average cost of homeowners insurance in Florida in 2026?',
    answer: 'The average Florida homeowner pays $5,838 per year for a $300,000 dwelling policy — 141% more than the national average of $2,424. However, rates vary dramatically by county, carrier, and home characteristics. State Farm\'s Florida average is approximately $2,090/year, less than half the state average. The difference comes down to your home\'s age, roof condition, location, and which carrier you choose.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which company has the cheapest homeowners insurance in Florida?',
    answer: 'Based on Bankrate\'s analysis of Quadrant Information Services data (updated 2025), State Farm has the lowest average premium in Florida at approximately $2,090/year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage. However, State Farm has limited availability in some Florida counties and is not writing new policies in all areas. Tower Hill, Kin Insurance, and Security First Financial are also competitive options depending on your location and property type.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Florida homeowners insurance cover hurricane damage?',
    answer: 'Standard Florida homeowners policies cover wind damage from hurricanes, but NOT flood damage. Flood coverage requires a separate policy through FEMA\'s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private flood insurer. Most Florida policies also carry a separate hurricane deductible — typically 2–5% of your dwelling coverage — which applies instead of your standard deductible when a named storm causes damage. On a $300,000 home, a 2% hurricane deductible means you pay the first $6,000 out of pocket.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Citizens Insurance and should I use it?',
    answer: 'Citizens Property Insurance Corporation is Florida\'s state-backed insurer of last resort. You qualify if no private insurer will cover your home, or if private quotes are more than 20% higher than Citizens\' rate. Citizens is not ideal if private alternatives exist — if Citizens cannot pay all claims after a major storm, it can levy assessments on all Florida policyholders, including those not insured by Citizens. Always compare private market options first.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I lower my Florida homeowners insurance premium?',
    answer: 'The most effective strategies: (1) Get a wind mitigation inspection — can reduce your wind premium by 15–45%; (2) Install hurricane shutters or impact-resistant windows; (3) Upgrade your roof — newer roofs with hip geometry cost significantly less to insure; (4) Raise your deductible from $1,000 to $2,500 — saves 10–15%; (5) Bundle home and auto with the same carrier — saves 5–15%; (6) Shop every year — Florida\'s market changes rapidly and loyalty rarely pays.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What AM Best rating should I look for in a Florida insurance company?',
    answer: 'Look for carriers with an AM Best financial strength rating of A- or better. This indicates the insurer has adequate financial resources to pay claims. In Florida\'s volatile market, carrier financial strength matters enormously — several Florida insurers have become insolvent in recent years. Avoid carriers rated below B+ unless you have no other options.',

      <h2>State Farm — Best Overall Value</h2>
      <p>State Farm has the lowest average premium in Florida at approximately $2,090/year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage — less than half the state average. Combined with an AM Best rating of A++ (Superior) and one of the largest agent networks in Florida, State Farm is the first carrier to check for most homeowners.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Homeowners in areas where State Farm is still actively writing policies. State Farm has limited availability in some high-risk coastal counties.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch for:</strong> State Farm stopped writing new policies in some Florida counties in recent years. Availability varies significantly by location. Always confirm they're writing in your area before investing time in a quote.</p>

      <h2>Tower Hill — Best Florida-Specific Carrier</h2>
      <p>Tower Hill Insurance Group is one of Florida's largest and most established domestic carriers, writing policies across the state including in coastal areas where national carriers won't go. Tower Hill has multiple product lines and can cover properties that don't qualify for standard market coverage.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Coastal homeowners, older homes, and properties that national carriers decline. Tower Hill's local expertise and willingness to write difficult risks makes them a critical option in Florida's market.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch for:</strong> Tower Hill's average premium is higher than State Farm. Their rates reflect the higher-risk properties they're willing to insure. Get a quote and compare carefully.</p>

      <h2>Kin Insurance — Best for Tech-Forward Homeowners</h2>
      <p>Kin is a technology-focused insurance company that uses data analytics to underwrite Florida properties more precisely than traditional carriers. This can result in competitive rates for homes with favorable risk profiles — newer construction, good wind mitigation, inland locations.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Newer homes with good wind mitigation features. Kin's data-driven underwriting often produces competitive quotes for properties that score well on their risk model.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch for:</strong> Kin is a newer carrier with less track record through a major hurricane season than established insurers. Check their current AM Best rating before binding coverage.</p>

      <h2>Security First Financial — Best for Standard Florida Homes</h2>
      <p>Security First Financial is a Florida-based carrier that has maintained a consistent presence in the state and offers a range of products for standard Florida homes. They are generally competitive for homes with newer roofs and good wind mitigation features.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Standard Florida homes with newer roofs looking for a Florida-focused private market alternative to Citizens.</p>

      <h2>Citizens Insurance — The Insurer of Last Resort</h2>
      <p>Citizens Property Insurance Corporation is Florida's state-backed insurer of last resort. As of 2026, Citizens insures approximately 1.2 million Florida policies — down from a peak of 1.4 million as the private market has partially stabilized through Florida's "depopulation" program.</p>
      <p><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> Homeowners who cannot find private market coverage within 20% of Citizens' rate, or whose property doesn't qualify for private market coverage at all.</p>
      <p><strong>The key risk:</strong> If Citizens cannot pay all claims after a major hurricane, it can levy assessments on all Florida policyholders — including those not insured by Citizens. This is a real financial risk for all Floridians. Always exhaust private market options before choosing Citizens.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>How to Get the Best Rate in Florida</h2>
      <p>Florida's insurance market rewards active shoppers. Here's the process that consistently produces the best results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Get a wind mitigation inspection first.</strong> A certified inspector documents your roof shape, age, and storm-resistance features. This report can reduce your wind premium by 15–45% and costs $75–$150. The payback period is often less than one month of premium savings.</li>
        <li><strong>Work with an independent agent.</strong> An independent agent can access quotes from multiple Florida carriers simultaneously and knows which carriers are currently competitive for your specific property type and location.</li>
        <li><strong>Get at least 3 quotes.</strong> Premium differences between carriers for the same property can be $2,000–$4,000 per year in Florida. Never accept the first quote.</li>
        <li><strong>Check AM Best ratings.</strong> Only consider carriers rated A- or better. A carrier that can't pay claims is worse than no carrier at all — and Florida has seen multiple insolvencies in recent years.</li>
        <li><strong>Shop every year.</strong> Florida's market changes constantly. The best carrier for your home today may not be the best carrier next year.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>Florida homeowners insurance is expensive, but it's not a commodity — the right carrier and the right coverage can make a $2,000–$4,000 annual difference. Start with a wind mitigation inspection, get quotes from at least three carriers, and prioritize financial strength over price. The cheapest policy from a carrier that can't pay claims is no policy at all.</p>
